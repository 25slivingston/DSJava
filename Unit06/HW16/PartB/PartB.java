/*Write a program that has a method that takes a variable number of double values 
as its argument.  The method then calculates and returns the average of these
 parameters as a double value.

public static double average(doubleâ€¦ values)

Test your method for the following cases,
average(10, 8, 10)
average(scores)  where scores is an array of doubles equal to {100, 90, 80, 100, 80}

Important Note: If you use a partially filled array to store your values,
 then when you calculate the average using your method, you should pass a 
 copy of your original array that only contains the valid test scores. 
 You can use the Arrays.copyOf() static method to make a new copy of the original 
 array that is only equal in length to the current size of your partially filled array.
